# Narayan Rahul Personal website

I am Narayan Rahul and I am from India. Taking web development as a profession not only fulfils my pocket but also my heart because it has been my passion since my early teenage.

I believe that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays. That’s why I chose web development as my career because I believe I’m good at this and mas I am always honest and I am never afraid of doing hard work.
